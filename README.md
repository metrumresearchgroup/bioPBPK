# About
A collection of open-source physiologically-based pharmacokinetics models implemented in `Julia` and `R (mrgsolve)`.

# Current models
1. A mAb PBPK model implemented in [Julia](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bioPBPK/blob/main/mAb_Jones2019/julia/)

# Near-term development
We anticipate incorporating the following items into near-term releases:

## mAb_Jones2019
### mrgsolve
1. Publishing an R-based mrgsolve version of mAb_Jones2019 model

### julia
1. Providing model parametrization for mice, rats, and monkeys
2. Generic antigen expression in tissues
3. Addition of a tumor compartment (a homogenous receptor agonist) model to the systemic PBPK model
