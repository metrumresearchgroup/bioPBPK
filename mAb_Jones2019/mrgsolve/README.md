# About
A whole-body PBPK model of monoclonal antibody (mAb) distribution is implemented in R using [mrgsolve](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve).
The entire model structure and parameters for IgG distribution are based on this publication [Jones et al., CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12461).

# Coming soon
An R-based mrgsolve version of this model will be provided shortly.
